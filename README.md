Kick at Moving Goal Game
This is a 2D soccer game of free kicks with players taking turns. One player at a time can kick the soccer ball targeting at a goal. The goal moves sideways.
Description
The moving speed of the goal will get faster as players go to the next level. Number of players is limited to be three. Scores are displayed on the left side as shown in the proposed wire frame below. The maximum score will be 10. 
Playing Instructions: Click the start game button and start kicking the ball within 5 seconds, If you stayed longer, it will be the turn of your opponent/opponents. Any player that scores 10 goals will be the winner! If both or all players score 10 after taking all their turns, it will be a tie. The game can be reset if any player's score is less than or equal to 5. If not, the game shall continue to the end. If any player wants to quit the game, the opponent will be the winner. The game will have a timer that limits every turn a player will have.
